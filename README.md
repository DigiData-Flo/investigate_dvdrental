# Investigate a Relational Database

A Udacity Project for SQL Introduction

## Purpose

In this project some queries needs to be written.  
I choose the example questions because I was little bit time critical.   
For this project an example PostgreSQL Database is provided  
https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/

## Challenge
The challenge was to install the postgreSQL Database. But after reading several comments and hints in the web I was successful.

## The Source Code Itself
There is a project_queries.sql with the written queries. This queries can be used to create the result tables.
